Simulate the cloud analyst environment as per the following specifications:

1. Create 5 data centers in continent north america, asia , australia and africa with 50 user bases in each continents. 

Name your data center as per your roll numbers ex: DC1_Roll
DC2_Roll


2.  User bases should have 100 user grouping factor and 100 request grouping factor in data centers with executable instruction length 150 per request (byte) with following load balancing policies. 
i. Round Robin
ii. Equally Spread current execution load
iii. Throttle

Rename your user as per roll number (001_UB1, 001_UB2, 001_UB3 etc)



Prepare a graph based on the average response time for this load balancing policies for the same specifications.

Prepare a comparison table as per the

Data center request servicing time
Overal response time
And Grand total cost ( total virtual machine cost + total transfer cost)


The experiment should be conducted for Closest data center service broker policies.
